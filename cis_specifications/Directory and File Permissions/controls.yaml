    description: |
      Files are always created using a default set of permissions. File permissions can be
      restricted by applying a permissions mask called the umask. The yugabyte user account
      should use a umask of 077 to deny file access to all user accounts except the owner.
    rationale: |

    audit: |
      To view the mask's current setting, execute the following commands:
      # whoami
      root
      # su - yugabyte
      # whoami
      yugabyte
      # umask 0022
      The umask must be 077 or more restrictive for the yugabyte user, otherwise, this is a
      fail.
