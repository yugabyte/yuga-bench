      YCQL authentication is based on roles. Roles can be created with superuser, nonsuperuser, and login privileges. New roles can be created, and existing ones altered or
      dropped by administrators using YCQL commands.
    rationale: |

    audit: |
      Run the following command to verify whether authentication is enabled on the YCQL
      interface of the YugabyteDB server.
      The YugabyteDB configuration files can be found in the conf directory of tarballs. For
      packages, the configuration files will be located in /home/user/var/conf.
      cat ts.config | grep use_cassandra_authentication
      If use_cassandra_authentication is set to false, then this is a finding.
