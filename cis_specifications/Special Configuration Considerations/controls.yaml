      Backup and restoration is the process of creating and storing copies of your data for
      protection against data loss. With a proper backup strategy, you can always restore
      your data to a most-recent known working state and minimize application downtime.
      This in turn guarantees business and application continuity.

      All the snapshots in the cluster are listed, along with their statuses.
