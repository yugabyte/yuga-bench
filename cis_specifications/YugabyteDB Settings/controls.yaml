    As YugabyteDB evolves with each new iteration, configuration parameters are
    constantly being added, deprecated, or removed. These configuration parameters
    define not only server function but how well it performs.

      Understanding the vulnerability of YugabyteDB runtime parameters by the particular
      delivery method, or attack vector.

    audit: |
      Review all configuration settings. Configure YugabyteDB logging to record all
      modifications and changes to the RDBMS.

    title: "Ensure 'backend' runtime parameters are configured correctly"
    profile_applicability:
      - "Level 1 - Yugabyte"
    description: |
      In order to serve multiple clients efficiently, the YugabyteDB server server launches a
      new "backend" process for each client. The runtime parameters in this benchmark
      section are controlled by the backend process. The server's performance, in the form of
      slow queries causing a denial of service, and the RDBM's auditing abilities for
      determining root cause analysis can be compromised via these parameters.
    rationale: |
      A denial of service is possible by denying the use of indexes and by slowing down client
      access to an unreasonable level. Unsanctioned behavior can be introduced by
      introducing rogue libraries which can then be called in a database session. Logging can
      be altered and obfuscated inhibiting root cause analysis.
    audit: |
      Issue the following command to verify the backend runtime parameters are configured
      correctly:
      yugabyte=# SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE context IN
      ('backend','superuser-backend') ORDER BY 1;
      name | setting
      -----------------------+---------
      ignore_system_indexes | off
      jit_debugging_support | off
      jit_profiling_support | off
      log_connections | off
      log_disconnections | off
      post_auth_delay | 0
      (6 rows)
      Note: Effecting changes to these parameters can only be made at server start.
      Therefore, a successful exploit may not be detected until after a server restart, e.g.,
      during a maintenance window.

    description: |
      YugabyteDB runtime parameters that are executed by the postmaster process.
    rationale: |
      The postmaster process is the supervisory process that assigns a backend process to
      an incoming client connection. The postmaster manages key runtime parameters that
      are either shared by all backend connections or needed by the postmaster process
      itself to run.
    audit: |
      The following parameters can only be set at server start by the owner of the
      YugabyteDB server process and cluster, typically the UNIX user account yugabyte.
      Therefore, all exploits require the successful compromise of either that UNIX account or
      the postgres superuser account itself.

      YugabyteDB runtime parameters that are executed by the SIGHUP signal.
    rationale: |
      In order to define server behavior and optimize server performance, the server's
      superuser has the privilege of setting these parameters which are found in the
      configuration files ysql_pg.conf and ysql_hba.conf.
    audit: |
      The following parameters can be set at any time, without interrupting the server, by the
      owner of the postmaster server process and cluster (typically UNIX user account
      yugabyte).

    rationale: |
      In order to improve and optimize server performance, the server's superuser has the
      privilege of setting these parameters which are found in the configuration file
      ysql_pg_conf_csv.

      The following parameters can only be set at server start by the owner of the

      the yugabyte superuser account itself.

    description: |
      These YugabyteDB runtime parameters are managed at the user account (ROLE) level.
    rationale: |
      In order to improve performance and optimize features, a ROLE has the privilege of
      setting numerous parameters in a transaction, session, or entity attribute. Any ROLE can
      alter any of these parameters.
    audit: |
      The method used to analyze the state of ROLE runtime parameters and to determine if
      they have been compromised is to inspect all catalogs and list attributes for database
      entities such as ROLEs and databases.

    description: |
      YugabyteDB clusters can be configured to use server-to-server encryption to protect
      data in transit between YugabyteDB servers. When enabled, Transport Layer Security
      (TLS), the successor to the deprecated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is used to ensure
      data protection for YSQL and YCQL only. Note that there is no planned support for
      YEDIS.
    rationale: |
      If TLS is not enabled and configured correctly, this increases the risk of data being
      compromised in transit.

    description: |
      YugabyteDB clusters can be configured to use client-to-server encryption to protect
      data in transit between YugabyteDB servers and clients, tools, and APIs. When
      enabled, Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to the deprecated Secure
      Sockets Layer (SSL), is used to ensure data protection for YSQL and YCQL only. Note
      that there is no planned support for YEDIS.
      Before you can enable client-to-server encryption, you first must enable server-to-server
      encryption.

      If TLS is not enabled and configured correctly, this increases the risk of data being
      compromised in transit.

      - "Level 1 - Yugabyte"
    description: |
      YugabyteDB must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
      disclosure or modification of organization-defined information at rest (to include, at a
      minimum, PII and classified information) on organization-defined information system
      components.
    rationale: |
      
    audit: |
      One possible way to encrypt data within YugabyeDB is to use the pgcrypto extension.
      To check if pgcrypto is installed on YugabyteDB, as a database administrator run the
      following commands:
      yugabyte=# SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name='pgcrypto';
      name | default_version | installed_version | comment
      ----------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------
      pgcrypto | 1.3 | | cryptographic functions
      (1 row)
      If data in the database requires encryption and pgcrypto is not available, this is a fail.
      If disk or filesystem requires encryption, ask the system owner, DBA, and SA to
      demonstrate the use of disk-level encryption. If this is required and is not found, this is a
      fail. If controls do not exist or are not enabled, this is also a fail.
    remediation: |
      
    impact: |
      
    default_value: |
      pgcrypto is pre-bundled with standard YugabyteDB distribution but requires installation.
